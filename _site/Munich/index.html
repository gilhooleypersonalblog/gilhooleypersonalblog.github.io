        <p>I finally got to meet up with Blake, Tony and Adam to start my last two weeks in Europe. Our first two stops are Munich and Salzburg</p>

<h1 id="munich">Munich</h1>

<h2 id="day-1-arrivals">Day 1: Arrivals</h2>

<p>Adam and I left Dusseldorf early on the 1st to make the long travel to Munich. 
We are old pros at the train systems now so the journey went by without an incident.
After making it to the main train station, we then took a ride out to the airport so we could pick up Blake. 
Blake had spent the summer working for Friendsy at Princeton.
He is spending the money from that to travel Europe all through August and most of September.
Making it back to the city, we checked into the AirBnb fine but our host, Markus, was no where to be found.
Overall the apartment was completely adequete and no more. He had an interesting choice in decorations and refridgerator stickers.</p>

<p><img src="/images/MunichAcademy.jpg" alt="Munich Academy" /></p>

<p>For dinner we stopped at a beer garden for bratwurst and sauerkraut so that Blake could get the authentic German experience.
We walked the whole city in the evening, seeing some amazing sights and buildings.
Because we didn’t have a guide book we couldn’t quite make out what each building was, but they were certainly pretty to look at.</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the night was finding a park where there was a person playing the Sitar.</p>

<p>Tony was supposed to arrive in the evening. This summer he had been working in Belfast, Ireland and he was taking a bus from Berlin.
Tony had forgetten about the time zone difference from Ireland to Berlin.
After walking around Berlin he found out he was an hour late for his bus! 
He could buy another bus to Munich, but it would arrive around 4 AM, so the whole gang didn’t arrive until the second day.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-dachau">Day 2: Dachau</h2>

<p><img src="/images/Dachau.jpg" alt="Dachau" /></p>

<p>We left in the morning to visit Dachau. We arrived early enough that most of the other visitors had not arrived and we could have some more personal moments with the memorials.</p>

<p>The morning fog made the atmosphere feel even more hallowed and the art exhibits were very powerful. 
This statue was located outside of the main officer and it represents the strength and spirit that the prisoners showed throughout their persecution.</p>

<h2 id="day-2-hofbrauhaus">Day 2: Hofbrauhaus</h2>

<p><img src="/images/Hofbrauhaus.jpg" alt="Hofbrauhaus" /></p>

<p>After resting for a bit at the apartment we went out for a good dinner at the famous Hofbrauhaus.
This is one of the largest beer gardens in the world and it can seat over 1,300 people.
For dinner I had Schweinshaxe which is a massive ‘pork knuckle’, a liter of great German beer, and a pretzel the size of my face.
We did some more walking after dinner but didn’t see anything important.</p>

<h2 id="day-3-neuschwanstein-and-hohenschwangau">Day 3: Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau</h2>

<p><img src="/images/CastleCity.jpg" alt="Castle City" /></p>

<p>For our last day in Munich we wanted to see Neuschwanstein, a giant castle that Walt Disney supposedly used as inspiration for the Disney logo.
It was a 3 hour train ride to get there, during which I managed to avoid paying for a ticket by another series of mistakes.
The castle area was incredibly beautiful and scenic, with massive mountains and a crystal blue lake. 
This beauty was marred a little by the large amounts of tourists which swarmed the small shops, resturaunts, and hiking trails.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Hohenschwangau.jpg" alt="Hohenschwangau" />
We saw Hohenschwangau first. This castle was the original castle for the royal family of Bavaria, while Neuschwanstein was built for Ludwig the Second so that he could have even more space.
The rooms were beautiful and gilded to excess, but the tour was sparse and gave very little information.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Neuschwanstein.jpg" alt="Neuschwanstein" /></p>

<p>The Neuschwanstein tour was better simply because the castle was more decadent. 
The walls were covered with scenes from Ludwig’s favorite stories and myths, which each sets of rooms having a different theme.
This castle was for Ludwig alone: he was not married yet and he did not like to appear in public. 
He seemed to be a lover of culture and art but he was a bit of a shut-in. 
The castle was built in 1869 but he devoted it to the Middle Age styles, which he adored.
On his mysterious death the castle was never finished.</p>

<h1 id="salzburg">Salzburg</h1>

<p><img src="/images/Salzburg.jpg" alt="Salzburg" /></p>

<p>We stayed in Salzburg for one full day. 
We arrived at the Hostel still in time for the unlimited breakfast for 3.50 euros. 
I ate 3 bowls of Musli, which is a German cereal that I love a lot (its basically just oats and milk).
With that good start to our day, we set off into the city to see the big churches.</p>

<p><img src="/images/SalzDom.jpg" alt="SalzDom" /></p>

<p>The first church we saw was the Salzburger Dom, which was unbelievably large and beautiful.
The sheer, awesome scale of these churches left a big impression on me. 
I can’t imagine these being built even with modern tools.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the church we saw that Mozart’s Requiem was being played that night and there were still tickets available. 
We decided that this would be the best use of our money for the day and we bought 4 tickets for the show. 
Although I do not know a lot about choir and classical music, the space and music made for an unforgettable experience.
The ceilings were so high that any loud note would reverberate for a few seconds in a very beautiful way.</p>

<p><img src="/images/PetersAbby.jpg" alt="PetersAbby" /></p>

<p>The other interesting thing we saw was Saint Peter’s Abby. It had a large connecting cemetary and a catacomb that was built into the cliffside. 
Walking though the catacombs it was clear that it was hewn by pretty rough tools.
There were much simpler altars in each of the rooms which provided a good contrast to the enormous churches we had been seeing earlier that day.</p>
