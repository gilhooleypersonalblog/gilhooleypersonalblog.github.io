        <p>Describing a relaxing, non travelling weekend in Dortmund and Dusseldorf.</p>

<h1 id="back-in-dortmund">Back in Dortmund</h1>

<p>This weekend I decided to take a much needed break from travelling and stay at home with some friends.
I didn’t exactly stay at <em>home</em> though because all of my friends from the program are still in Dortmund.
If I haven’t told you, I was required to move to Dusseldorf for my internship with SMS.
The train ride from Dusseldorf to Dortmund is about an hour and a half if you are lucky.
For almost the first time in a month and a half, I was lucky! The train ride went without any interruptions.</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed back in Dortmund is that the town had quickly become small.
After travelling all over Germany and seeing many different areas, Dortmund didn’t seem unusually different.
The quaint German houses, the brick lined streets, and the bustling train station were nothing new to me at this point and it was comforting to know that in my travels I have adapted to an entirely different way of life.</p>

<p>It being a weekend, I couldn’t take the hanging rail to my dorm. Now that I finally have a camera, I got some good shots of what the forest looks like in between my old dorm and the rest of campus.</p>

<h1 id="going-out-in-the-city">Going out in the City</h1>

<p>It was nice to finally see Andy and Wanda again and I was also introduced to Andy’s friend Hannah who was visiting from Cambridge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/DortmundClubbing.jpg" alt="Hanging out with friends again!" /></p>

<p>Being around the Ruhr fellows was a welcome break from seeing mostly Germans every day.
We found some clubs that were fun and some that were funny that night. 
My personal highlight of the night was going to a club that was basically unattended.
We were essentially the only four people on the dance floor when they started blaring a very eery remix of “Fresh Prince of Bel Air”, which probably stands as the weirdest thing I have heard in a club.</p>

<h1 id="daytime-dortmund">Daytime Dortmund</h1>

<p>The next day Andy and Hannah decided to go hiking, so Wanda and I ran some errands in Dortmund.
I finally made it to the Post Office so I could send some gifts home to my family.
On the outside of the Post Office were these two amazing statues of Hand People!
They clearly symbolize the Ruhr Area’s deindustrialization and the people’s fading identification with manual labor, as well as the painful struggle for new work.
Plus, the Hand-People have butts, which is hilarious!</p>

<p><img src="/images/HandStatues.jpg" alt="Hand Statues" /></p>

<p>After that we finally made it to the resturaunt that our German teacher Matthaus told us about, the KartoffelLord! 
It is a small hipster restuaraunt that only sells potatoes and other vegetarian dishes (for Germany vegetarian is a big deal).
The portions were huge and delicious. I would love to go back.</p>

<h1 id="dusseldorf-fair">Dusseldorf Fair</h1>

<p>Near dinnertime Wanda and I left for Dusseldorf to go see the amusement park. 
This park is held every year, but only for a week or two.
All of the rides are built on the uninhabited side of the Rhein river just for this event, and my coworkers told me that people visit from the Netherlands and France just for the park.</p>

<p><img src="/images/BridgeView.JPG" alt="View from Bridge" />
The fair was absolutely packed with people, the train that we caught to the fair practically had people hanging out of the windows.</p>

<p>There was plenty of good food at the fair! 
It was mostly traditional German food like giant pieces of meat or unreasonably large sausages or humongous pretzels filled with butter.
I wasn’t surprised to find that Germans could pull off fair food really well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/OlympicRings.JPG" alt="Olympic Rings" /></p>

<p>Wanda and I went up on the Ferris wheel and on a massive roller coaster called the Olympic Rings. 
There were plenty of rides which ranged from little kid bumper cars to spinning, strobing, metal death traps. 
The food was cheap but the rides themselves were very expensive, which was the opposite of US parks.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great day. Sunday was spent relaxing and getting the rest of my things in order. It’s always good to sit back and rest before the next adventure.</p>
