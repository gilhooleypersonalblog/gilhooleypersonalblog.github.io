An explanation of the first week of my trip through Germany! This post covers airports, Cologne, and some great food and friends.

# Arriving Across the Pond

I arrived in Düsseldorf Internation Airport on June 1st after going through the longest flight in my life.
On the flight I watched Birdman and Interstellar for free.
Both of the movies were really interesting, but when I arrived in Düsseldorf I regretted not having the extra sleep. 
The other person arriving at the time was Nick Gailey, a Ruhr Fellow from Berkeley.
He was very nice and down to earth.
This is either his second or third time in Germany so I think I will be coming to him for German help throughout the trip.

We met our German doubles at the train station and made it back to the dorms in TU Dortmund in one piece. I met most of the other Ruhr Fellows in front of the train station at the University and we set off to the main city.
At the first stop a Ruhr Fellow named Charles thought it was the city so we all ended up leaving the train. 
Because we got off at the wrong station we had to wait for almost an hour for the next train.
I didn't mind too much because it gave us plenty of time to get to know the other Ruhr Fellows.
Luckily most of them also do not really speak German, so I don't feel too embarrassed that my language is on the level of a small toddler. 

When we finally arrived at the city Laura (the program director) treated us all to dinner. 
The burger and beer that I ordered were delicious and a great introduction to German food!

# Ich spreche kein deutsch: Introduction to German lessons

We have a few classes that we are required to take for the first month: daily German language class, weekly Culture/Technology courses with other TU students, and a weekly private series on culture.
Most of our time is going to be spent visiting the Ruhr area and the companies located there.
We seem to be mostly meeting with CEOs, politicians, and academics.
I guess you could say we are high-profile Americans living in Germany for this month.

The German lessons seem to be going pretty slow. Every time I learn a phrase I am reminded of how many I simply do not know. 
Whenever I want to ask to use the bathroom, ask for the price of something, or introduce myself I can only think of how to say things in Spanish.
The good news is that I learned a lot of Spanish throughout High School.
The even better news is that this is just making me more determined to learn German.

# The Doubles

We were also introduced to our German doubles this week. These doubles are also students in our Culture and Technology class. 
My double's name is Dennis. 
He speaks perfect English and is very friendly.
My main goal this month is to have a casual conversation with him in German.
After meeting the doubles Dennis introduced me to FlunkeBall, a drinking game known throughout Germany. 
The goal is to knock over a bottle of water that has been placed between the two teams. 
The team that knocks the bottle over gets to drink until the other team puts the bottle back upright. 
The first team to finish all of their beers wins.
My introduction to this game illustrates the differences in drinking culture between Germany and the United States. 
In Germany the game is set up so that it is the winners that are drinking. 
This prevents the negative feedback loop seen in America where the losers continually get worse at the game.
It also solidifies drinking beer as something that is positive and part of the culture.

# The First Free Day: A trip to Köln (Cologne)

We had the first Thursday free for a religious holiday so we decided to travel to Cologne.
The Cologne Cathedral was the first thing that we saw outside of the train station. 
It is an awe-inspiring building and it is one of the largest pieces of intricate architecture I have ever seen.

The experience was enhanced by the fact that the holiday was being celebrated at the Cathedral. 
We soon found ourselves stuck in a crowd lining a pack of priests and large procession of people in red and white outfits.
While we couldn't understand what was going on, it was a pretty interesting and a good start to the day.

After lunch Andy, Wanda and I visited the Ludwig Museum of Modern Art. 
The museum had the largest standing collection of Picassos. 
I found all of the exhibits to be very interesting, they had some very beautiful abstract paintings.

We finished the trip by walking across the Hohenzollern bridge.
This is one of Europe's lock bridges.
This means that couples put a lock on the bridge and throw the key into the Rhine river to symbolize their lasting relationship.
There were an unbelievable amount of locks on the bridge of all different shapes and sizes.
We even heard from someone that many of the locks were taken down because their combined weight were threatening the bridge.
If I read that fact in a novel I would think that the author was being a little heavy handed with the symbolism.

# An Event with the Chancellor: A trip to Bochum

On the Saturday of the first week we had a large even in Bochum University, the sister university to TU Dortmund. 
The event was being held to celebrate Bochum's 50th anniversary. 
Bochum is one of the first _new_ universities that was created in the Ruhr area and it is apparently very dear to the German people.

The event consisted of dancers, an orchestra, and a speech by the German President, Joachim Gauck. 
The event would have been great except for the fact that we were never really given food and it was dragging on until the afternoon. 
What started out as one of the fanciest events quickly became a sort of foodless prison.
We were all happy when we were able to come back to Dortmund so we could start our real weekend, catch up on some much needed sleep, and finally go food shopping.
