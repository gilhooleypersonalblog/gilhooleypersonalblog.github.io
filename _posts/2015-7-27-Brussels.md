Another great weekend! This is what Adam and I did in Belgium with the wonderful Bowers family.

# The Bowers Family

My good friend Adam Cellon has also been in Germany these last two months, living in Duisberg. 
His family is originally from Virginia beach but because his dad works in the Navy they know families that are stationed all over the world.
The Bower family is one such family. 
They lived in Virginia but they have been stationed at the NATO base in Jurbise, Belgium for a little over a year.
The family consists of Mr. and Mrs. Bowers and their two kids, Ethan and Meghan who are 10 and 6 respectively. 
Meghan is an extremely rambuncious little girl who speaks half in English and half in French because she has been learning French in school.
She has a pet ladybug and wishes that she still could take gymnastics classes.
Ethan is attending classes on the base. 
He loves Legos and Minecraft, telling stories and explaining differences between Belgium and the US.

The town of Jurbise is located 40 minutes outside of the city of Brussels. 
While the country of Belgium has four prominent languages (Flemish, French, Dutch, and German), French is dominant in this region.
Jurbise is a quaint town that sprung up in the middle of flat farmlands. 
The city itself has maybe 12 houses and a few streets, but like all things in Europe there is a beautiful brick church and plenty of things to see.
The horizon is filled with crops of potato and wheat as well as pastures for cows and donkeys.

# Getting to Belguim

Adam managed to figure out a way to cut our cost of travel in half; we would take a train to Belgium and then a bus back.
The train tickets were purchased through the Duestche Bahn website, but for some strange reason the tickets could only be mailed (instead of being printed out or downloaded to the DB app).
Adam received his tickets in two days, but for reasons unknown to me my tickets never arrived at my apartment in Dusseldorf.
The day of my journey I printed out my only piece of information, an email that claimed I had paid for these missing tickets.
I reasoned that we were almost never stopped for tickets in Germany, and that if we were, I could look confused and show them the email.

Adam and I were stopped on all three of our trains by people looking for our tickets.
Each time I looked very apologetic and offered up my email and my American passport.
The ticket checkers had varying degrees of English abilities.
One looked very disappointed in me, another just kept walking after he heard English, but I made the journey without being fined or held by train authorities.

The greatest part about the journey is that after getting internet at the Bowers house I receieved an email from DB. Because my ticket was lost in the mail, I was refunded the full train cost! My combination of good/bad luck had saved me 37 euros!

## Saturday -- Pancakes, Legos, Puzzles, and The Medieval Festival

Saturday brought us a day of uncertain rain (Mr. Bowers told us that Brussel's weather was exactly the same as Seattle in terms of rainfall/sunny days).
We had all originally planned to ride RailBikes on Saturday, which involved a three hour bike ride on a repurposed railroad track, but the uncomfortable prospect of getting wet made us reconsider. 
We started the morning instead with one of America's greatest inventions, the breakfast pancake. 
The chocalate chip pancakes were such a welcome suprise to a traveler who had grown a little homesick and more than a little tired with German food. 
With the pancakes weighing us down we had a lazy morning.
I read my kindle and built some minecraft legos with Ethan until lunch.

After lunch we decided to go visit a French Medieval Festival that was in town for the weekend.
The festival was filled with families in old fashioned clothes who were fletching arrows and carrying large hunks of meat around.
There were rows and rows of extravagent medieval tents as if the fair were just an old fashion army camping out over the weekend.
It was clear that these families were sleeping in the tents over the weekend and we all admired the fact that they were here doing this in inclement weather.

Ethan was in absolute heaven because at one tent we were able to hold shields and various swords, touch chainmail, and even wear a metal knight's helmet.
Ethan kept trying to buy one of the wooden training swords, but Mrs. Bowers stopped him so he didn't try to terrorize the surrounding neighborhood.

## Sunday -- Grand Place, Manneken Pis, Chocolate Museum, and the Royal Museums of Fine Art 

Early Sunday morning Adam and I headed out to the city of Brussels.
We started our morning with a great breakfast on the square of the Grand Place.
The Grand Place (pronounced Platz) has been important to Brussels since the 14th century and hosts a beautiful town hall adorned with gold and stone statues.

My breakfast was a smoked salmon omelette where Adam's ended up being a basket of bread and a few pieces of fruit.

Near the square is a 61 cm tall bronze statue known as 'Manneken Pis'.
This little guy is the greatest, partly because he is just a statue of a peeing child and partly because the entire city is obsessed with him.
There is a museum (which we sadly missed) where you can find over 600 of this guy's little outfits.

After our morning adventures, we walked into Brussel's Chocolate Museum. 
The highlight of the Museum was 'tasting' different types of chocolate to distinguish the differences in cocoa percentages.
I personally used that part of the tour to eat as much Belgium chocolate as possible, and the tour was totally worth our 5 euros.

Next we visited the Royal Museum of Fine Art.
The museum featured Flemmish painters from the 16th and 17th century.
There were also some beautiful landscape paintings and many gorgeous sculptures.

Feeling exhausted from our day, we grabbed a beer and some fries and waited for the bus home.
This week will be my last at the internship: I will begin my two weeks of travel with my friends from home soon.
It will be very nice to see my friends again and it is going to be a good change of pace to stop working.
