This is is my first post! For the upcoming summer this blog is going to be mostly about my two month trip to Germany.
I will be leaving on May 31st and arriving in Dortmund on June 1st. For the first month I'll be studying at Dortmund University, mostly learning German.
The second month I will be working at [SMS Siemag Aktiengesellschaft](www.sms-siemag.com). 
If anyone is going to be around the area or wants to practice German please let me know!

The posts that aren't personal will deal with cool things that I find or do in computer science. 
This blog is currently written with [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted for free on [github pages] (https://pages.github.com/). 
I chose Jekyll for the blog because the entire website is kept in plain-text markdown.
This lets me writeup everything with whatever editor I want (vim!) and it allows me to write and make changes without internet.
I can store the whole blog on my chromebook and push to github whenever I happen to have internet access. 
Jekyll also allows me to host the site locally and the templating system is very similar to Django!
